CSI staggered spin-up support
Overview
Hard drive spin-up was always the highest power consuming stage. Embedded devices mostly use low power suppliers that sometimes needs to drive numerous hard drives.
This feature developed in order to prevent the power supply’s overloading when numerous hard drives spin-up.

Usage
Apply the staggered spin-up kernel patch.
Compile the kernel with the config CONFIG_MV_STAGGERED_SPINUP enabled.

Pass the following parameter in the kernel line:
spinup_config=<spinup_max>,<spinup_timeout>
For example: spinup_config=2,6 will config the module for 2 maximum disks spinning-up with 6 seconds timeout.
Parameters explanation:
	1.	<spinup_max> - The maximum spinning-up disks(can be between 1 and 8)  will be like this:
		a.	0 = feature off.
		b.	1 – 8 = number of disks
		c.	<0,>8 = invalid parameter (will behave like feature off)
	2.	<spinup_timeout> - The spin-up timeout (can be between 1 and 6) will be like this:
		a.	0 = feature off.
		b.	1 – 6 = in seconds
		c.	<0,>6 = invalid parameter (will behave like feature off)

Any parsing error will cause an invalid parameters print and will behave as feature off.

EXPERIMANTAL kernel config:
CONFIG_MV_DISKS_POWERUP_TO_STANDBY – on boot initialization all hard drives will assume to be in standby.
