.SH NAME
lsmod \- program to show the status of modules in the Linux Kernel
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlsmod\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBlsmod\fR is a trivial program which nicely
formats the contents of the \fI/proc/modules\fR,
showing what kernel modules are currently loaded.
.SH "BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
This version of \fBlsmod\fR is for kernels
2.5.48 and above.  If it detects a kernel
with support for old-style modules, it will attempt to run
\fBlsmod.old\fR in its place, so it is completely
transparent to the user.
