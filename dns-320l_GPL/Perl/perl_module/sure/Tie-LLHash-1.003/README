Hi,

This is the Tie::LLHash.pm module.  It is a class for implementing
ordered Perl hashes.  It is designed to be flexible and sub-classible.

It also may change significantly - this is only version 0.01, after all =).

For more specific information, please see the documentation inside
LLHash.pm, by doing "pod2txt LLHash.pm", or "perldoc Tie::LLHash" once
you've installed the module.

To install the module, do the usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
