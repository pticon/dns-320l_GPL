Change log for Tie-LLHash:

1.003

 - delete($hash{$key}) now returns the associated value, previously it
   returned an internal data structure not meant for external use.

 - With normal perl hashes, the caller can call delete() in a loop
   that uses the hash's iterator, as long as the item being deleted is
   the most recent item returned by the iterator.  This wasn't working
   in Tie::LLHash, but now it's fixed.  [Spotted by Steve Tolkin]

 - Un-synchronized version numbers with CVS

1.002  2000/04/01 16:04:27

 - Added more documentation about the differences between this module and
   Tie::IxHash.
   
 - Synchronized version numbers with CVS.

0.04  Wed Dec  1 22:51:01 EST 1999

 - Added 'lazy-mode', which allows you to append new entries to the end
   of the hash by assigning to the hash by doing $hash{key} = 'value';
   
0.03

 - fixed a fatal bug in the current_value() method

 - insert(key,value) now equivalent to first(key,value),
   making it somewhat easier to insert values at the beginning
   of the hash.

 - wrote documentation for the non-TIEHASH methods

0.02  Wed May 20 19:21:52 1998

 - forgot to include a README file in the original distribution, so I
   added one now

 - running all tests now won't give any warnings under -w flag

 - added tests 7-10

 - fixed some problems with the DELETE method - it went wrong when
   deleting the last element in a hash

 - insert() didn't work right when inserting after the last element

 - can give initialization hash for tie() constructor

0.01  Mon May 11 17:45:43 1998

 - original version; created by h2xs 1.18
